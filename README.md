# Ploufybot

Experimental Slack bot using [Deno SDK](https://api.slack.com/future/overview).

## Prerequisites

- [Slack CLI](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart)
- [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.4/getting_started/installation)

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you
have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one set up, go ahead and
[create one](https://slack.com/create).

## Create the Link Trigger

[Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers) are what cause Workflows to
run. These Triggers can be invoked by a user, or automatically as a response to
an event within Slack.

A [Link Trigger](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers/link) is a type of
Trigger that generates a **Shortcut URL** which, when posted in a channel or
added as a bookmark, becomes a link. When clicked, the Link Trigger will run the
associated Workflow.

```bash
slack trigger create --trigger-def ./triggers/prepare.ts
```

After selecting a Workspace, the output provided will include the Link Trigger
Shortcut URL. Copy and paste this URL into a channel as a message, or add it as
a bookmark in a channel of the Workspace you selected.

**Note: this link won't run the Workflow until the app is either running locally
or deployed!** Read on to learn how to run your app locally and eventually
deploy it to Slack hosting.

## Running Your Project Locally

While building your app, you can see your changes propagated to your workspace
in real-time with `slack run`. In both the CLI and in Slack, you'll know an app
is the development version if the name has the string `(dev)` appended.

```zsh
# Run app locally
$ slack run

Connected, awaiting events
```

Once running, click the
[previously created Shortcut URL](#create-a-link-trigger) associated with the
`(dev)` version of your app. This should start the Message Setup Workflow.

To stop running locally, press `<CTRL> + C` to end the process.

## Testing

Test filenames should be suffixed with `_test`. Run all tests with `deno test`:

```zsh
$ deno test
```

## Deploying Your App

Once you're done with development, you can deploy the production version of your
app to Slack hosting using `slack deploy`:

```zsh
$ slack deploy
```

After deploying, [create a new Link Trigger](#create-a-link-trigger) for the
production version of your app (not appended with `(dev)`). Once the Trigger is
invoked, the Workflow should run just as it did in when developing locally.

### Viewing Activity Logs

Activity logs for the production instance of your application can be viewed with
the `slack activity` command:

```zsh
$ slack activity
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.ts`

The [app manifest](https://api.slack.com/future/manifest) contains the app's
configuration. This file defines attributes like app name and description.

### `slack.json`

Used by the CLI to interact with the project's SDK dependencies. It contains
script hooks that are executed by the CLI and implemented by the SDK.

### `/functions`

[Functions](https://api.slack.com/future/functions) are reusable building blocks
of automation that accept inputs, perform calculations, and provide outputs.
Functions can be used independently or as steps in Workflows.

### `/workflows`

A [Workflow](https://api.slack.com/future/workflows) is a set of steps that are
executed in order. Each step in a Workflow is a function.

Workflows can be configured to run without user input or they can collect input
by beginning with a [form](https://api.slack.com/future/forms) before continuing
to the next step.

### `/triggers`

[Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers) determine when Workflows are
executed. A trigger file describes a scenario in which a workflow should be run,
such as a user pressing a button or when a specific event occurs.

### `/datastores`

[Datastores](https://api.slack.com/future/datastores) can securely store and
retrieve data for your application. Required scopes to use datastores include
`datastore:write` and `datastore:read`.
